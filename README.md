# Welcome to the paxxous alto sax music creator.

## IMPORTANT

This only supports a few notes, g, a, b, c, high d, high e, high f, and high g. Look man I'm not some sort of saxophone prodigy. I recorded all of the notes myself.



## Creation:

This was made completely with python, Or at least what I of right now. I think I'll make the installer in c++ though.

I'm also learning git with this too. It's a pretty useful tool based on what I have done, and I don't have any friends who know how to computer program so I can't really collaborate that much. This is honestly just a learning experience I need a project to do. I'm stuck in this hole where I know how to program, and I don't know what to program.



Just updated to make the project public, I think that it's ready enough

## installation

Im working with c++ to make an installer that you just have to download and execute, but it's hard to make a get request with c++.

I also haven't compiled the python file to an exe so if you want to run it then you would have to have python already installed. (Oh and also you need to have the playsound version 1.2.2 and os module installed so that it runs smoothly)



Installation using git:

```
git clone https://github.com/Paxxous/Alto-Saxophone-Music-Creator.git
```
