# Welcome to the paxxous alto sax music creator.

## IMPORTANT

This only supports a few notes, g, a, b, c, high d, high e, high f, and high g. Look man I'm not some sort of saxophone prodigy. I recorded all of the notes myself.



## Creation:

This was made completely with python, Or at least what I of right now. I think I'll make the installer in c++ though.

I'm also learning git with this too. It's a pretty useful tool based on what I have done, and I don't have any friends who know how to computer program so I can't really collaborate that much. This is honestly just a learning experience I need a project to do. I'm stuck in this hole where I know how to program, and I don't know what to program.
